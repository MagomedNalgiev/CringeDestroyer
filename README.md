# Cringe Destroyer

Cringe Destroyer is a single page web toy designed to "annihilate" cringe text, links, or images. Upload something cringe-worthy, choose an emotion, and watch it disappear with flashy effects and sound.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser and interact with the page:

1. Paste cringe text or a link, or select an image file.
2. Choose an emotion effect.
3. Click **АННИГИЛИРОВАТЬ** to destroy the cringe.

The page is completely client‑side. For the best experience open it via an HTTP server or simply double‑click `index.html` if your browser allows local file access.

## Dependencies

The repository includes all needed files:

- `gif.worker.js` – a JavaScript worker used by the page.
- `boom.mp3` – sound effect played on actions.

No additional libraries or build steps are required; just a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.
